# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html

# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------

# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: app-monitoring

# Run in single-node mode
#
discovery.type: single-node

# Create a new cluster with the current node only
# Additional nodes can still join the cluster later
# cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["app-monitoring-0"]

# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------

# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: app-monitoring-0

# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------

# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
#
path.data: /data/elasticsearch

# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
#
#bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------

# By default Elasticsearch is only accessible on localhost. Set a different
# address here to expose this node on the network:
#
network.host: 127.0.0.1

# By default Elasticsearch listens for HTTP traffic on the first free port it
# finds starting at 9200. Set a specific HTTP port here:
#
http.port: 9200

#----------------------- BEGIN SECURITY AUTO CONFIGURATION -----------------------
#
# The following settings, TLS certificates, and keys have been automatically
# generated to configure Elasticsearch security features on 07-06-2025 06:00:17
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Enable security features
xpack.security.enabled: true

xpack.security.enrollment.enabled: true

# Enable encryption for HTTP API client connections, such as Kibana, Logstash, and Agents
xpack.security.http.ssl:
  enabled: true
  keystore.path: certs/http.p12

# Enable encryption and mutual authentication between cluster nodes
xpack.security.transport.ssl:
  enabled: true
  verification_mode: certificate
  keystore.path: certs/transport.p12
  truststore.path: certs/transport.p12

# Allow HTTP API connections only from localhost
# Connections are encrypted and require user authentication
http.host: 127.0.0.1

# Allow other nodes to join the cluster from nowhere
# Connections are encrypted and mutually authenticated
transport.host: 127.0.0.1

#----------------------- END SECURITY AUTO CONFIGURATION -------------------------
