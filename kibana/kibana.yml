# =================== System: Kibana Server ===================
# Kibana is served by a back end server. This setting specifies the port to use.
server.port: 5601

# Specifies the address to which the Kibana server will bind. IP addresses and host names are both valid values.
# The default is 'localhost', which usually means remote machines will not be able to connect.
# To allow connections from remote users, set this parameter to a non-loopback address.
server.host: "localhost"

# Specifies the public URL at which Kibana is available for end users. If
# `server.basePath` is configured this URL should end with the same basePath.
server.publicBaseUrl: "https://app-monitoring.unibuc.ro/"

# The Kibana server's name. This is used for display purposes.
server.name: "app-monitoring"

# =================== System: Elasticsearch ===================
# The URLs of the Elasticsearch instances to use for all your queries.
